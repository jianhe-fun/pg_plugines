worker_spi, custom bgworker for PostgreSQL
=========================================

Background worker able to query backend for a certain amount of time regularly.

This worker can use the following parameter to decide the interval of time
used to execute a query and insert connections.
- worker_spi.naptime allowed for backends to be execute query in seconds. Default set at 10s.

Idle backend scan is done with a loop operation on pg_stat_activity, running
at the same interval of time as the above parameter.

TODO worker_spi.naptime currently cannot be changed after server starts,
 maybe it can changed in PGC_SIGHUP context.
